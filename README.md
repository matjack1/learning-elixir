# Learning Elixir

This project is meant to be a notebook for me and other people getting started with Elixir.

I'm starting now, Aug 2019, with Elixir 1.9.

## First steps

Looking for the best place to start, by chance, I ended up reading the [release notes](https://elixir-lang.org/blog/2019/06/24/elixir-v1-9-0-released/) of v1.9 as I didn't want to start with obsolete guides. With my great pleasure at the bottom of the document I read:

> If you are looking for a more fast paced introduction to the language, see the [How I Start: Elixir](http://howistart.org/posts/elixir/1/index.html) tutorial, which has also been brought to the latest and greatest.

And that was exactly what I was looking for.

## Flashcards

I'm tracking my progress also in a set of Anki flashcards that you can get as a [shared deck](https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/1842975462).

The [Anki manual](https://apps.ankiweb.net/docs/manual.html) is a great place to start also for learning more about flashcards.

I'm also using the [AnkiDroid](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.ichi2.anki) app synced via AnkiWeb to review my card and keep all in sync.

Only the sharing is a manual process that I need to do every now and then to resync my deck with the shared one.
